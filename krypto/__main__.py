# TODO[Enhancement]: Possible creation of pre-push git hook @https://github.com/antoniouaa/krypto/issues/32
# Think about making this into a git script to hook into the pre-push action
# instead of having to run the script manually
# Lets try to test this right now.
# Considering making a github action instead of a messy post-push hook
